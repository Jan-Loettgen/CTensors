# CTensors
Update 22/06/2022: too busy to work on this at the moment, currently this repository contains only some of the early ideas i was toying with.

This repository is a side project that I am working on for fun and to learn more about C, Cuda, Neural networks and parralell programming. 
Currently the code only supports matrix manipulations but i intend to extend it to support tensors of any dimension.
